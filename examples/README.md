# Examples

Here are three example files to try out the period detection.
The data in the files have the following properties:
- Example 1: Just the raw periodic data
- Example 2: Periodic data with noise
- Example 3: Data with a strong trend


To try it out just execute:
```Python
from find_period import find_period

find_period(path="exampleN.csv")
```
Feel free to play around with the other parameters!
